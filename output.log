# Approach:
# The given requirement seems to be a bit ambiguous as it mentions 'a light that does not produce light'. 
# However, we can interpret this as a class or object that represents a light, but does not actually produce any light.
# In this case, we can create a class named 'Light' in Python, which has methods to turn the light on and off. 
# But since it's a virtual representation, it won't actually produce any light.

class Light:
    def __init__(self):
        # The initial state of the light is off
        self.state = "off"

    def turn_on(self):
        # This method turns the light on
        self.state = "on"

    def turn_off(self):
        # This method turns the light off
        self.state = "off"

    def get_state(self):
        # This method returns the current state of the light
        return self.state

# Example usage:
light = Light()  # Create a new light
light.turn_on()  # Turn the light on
print(light.get_state())  # Print the current state of the light
light.turn_off()  # Turn the light off
print(light.get_state())  # Print the current state of the light
```
This code represents a virtual light that can be turned on and off, but does not actually emit any light. The 'state' attribute represents whether the light is currently on or off. The 'turn_on', 'turn_off', and 'get_state' methods allow you to change the state of the light and check its current state.
